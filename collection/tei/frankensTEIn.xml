                     Bodleian MS. Abinger c.56 (formerly designated Dep. 477/1) consists of 62 leaves originally bound in Notebook A, 
                     one of two now disbound notebooks in which Mary W. Shelley (MWS) drafted the two-volume version of Frankenstein. 
                     The draft in c.56 runs from the beginning to the end of Volume I, concluding just as the Creature is about to 
                     begin his tale to Victor.

            <p> 
               <lb/>It was on a dreary night of November,
               <lb/>that I beheld the accomplishment of my
               <lb/>toils. With an anciety that almost
               <lb/>amounted to agony, I collected the instru-
               <lb/>ments of life around me, that might
               <lb/>infuse a spark of being into the lifeles
               <lb/>thing that lay at my feet. It was already
               <lb/>one in the morning; the rain pattered dis-
               <lb/>mally against the panes, and my candle
               <lb/>was nearly burnt out, when by the glim-
               <lb/>mer of the half-extinguished light, I saw
               <lb/>the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it
               <lb/>breathed hard, and a concvulsive motion
               <lb/>agitated its limbs.
            </p>
            <p>
               <lb/>How can I describe my emotions at this
               <lb/>catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch
               <lb/>whom with such infinite pains and care I
               <lb/>had endeavoured to form? His limbs were
               <lb/>in proportion, and I had selected his fea-
               <lb/>tures as beautiful. Beautiful!–––Great God!
               <lb/>His yellow skin scarcely covered the work
               <lb/>of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair
               <lb/>was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his
               <lb/>teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these lux-
            </p>
