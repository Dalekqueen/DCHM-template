                     </h2>
                     
                     <p> 
                        <br>It was on a dreary night of November,
                        <br>that I beheld the accomplishment of my
                        <br>toils. With an anciety that almost
                        <br>amounted to agony, I collected the instru-
                        <br>ments of life around me, that might
                        <br>infuse a spark of being into the lifeles
                        <br>thing that lay at my feet. It was already
                        <br>one in the morning; the rain pattered dis-
                        <br>mally against the panes, and my candle
                        <br>was nearly burnt out, when by the glim-
                        <br>mer of the half-extinguished light, I saw
                        <br>the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it
                        <br>breathed hard, and a concvulsive motion
                        <br>agitated its limbs.
                        
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>
                        <br>How can I describe my emotions at this
                        <br>catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch
                        <br>whom with such infinite pains and care I
                        <br>had endeavoured to form? His limbs were
                        <br>in proportion, and I had selected his fea-
                        <br>tures as beautiful. Beautiful!–––Great God!
                        <br>His yellow skin scarcely covered the work
                        <br>of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair
                        <br>was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his
                        <br>teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these lux-
